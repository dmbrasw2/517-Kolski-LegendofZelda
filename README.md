3. Breath of the Wild
4. Twilight Princess

### Ocarina of Time

[Releaseed for the Nintendo 64 in 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time)

- My first Legend of Zelda game!
- I used to play on my brother's completed file and just run around on Epona. I treated it like an open world game.
- I've beaten the game myself multiple times.

### Majora's Mask

[Releaseed for the Nintendo 64 in 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Majora%27s_Mask)

- Fun fact: I've never actually played it myself. I tried, but the timer stressed me out too much haha.
- I love the story and characters too much to leave it out.
- But I've watched several playthroughs, speedruns, and story breakdowns, so I know the plot and general game mechanics.

### Breath of the Wild

[Released for the WiiU and Nintendo Switch in 2017.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild)

- I mean, obviously. This is the open world I treated post-game OoT as, but now that's actually the whole game.
- Love the exploration and flexibility of plot points and quests.
- Figuring out the different weapon types and gathering weapons and ingredients is great busywork to get you exploring the world.
