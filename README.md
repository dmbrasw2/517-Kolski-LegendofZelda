## My Favorite LoZ games

### Ocarina of Time

- My first Legend of Zelda game!
- I used to play on my brother's completed file and just run around on Epona. I treated it like an open world game.
- I've beaten the game myself multiple times.

### Majora's Mask

- Fun fact: I've never actually played it myself. I tried, but the timer stressed me out too much haha.
- I love the story and characters too much to leave it out.
- But I've watched several playthroughs, speedruns, and story breakdowns, so I know the plot and general game mechanics.

### Breath of the Wild

- I mean, obviously. This is the open world I treated post-game OoT as, but now that's actually the whole game.
- Love the exploration and flexibility of plot points and quests.
- Figuring out the different weapon types and gathering weapons and ingredients is great busywork to get you exploring the world.
